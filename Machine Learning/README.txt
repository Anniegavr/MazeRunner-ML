=== INTRODUCTION ===

The main goal of this side of the project is to develope Machine Learning agents who will proceed through different mazes and collect data based on their performances.
After some researching found out the optimal ML agent methods to accomplish the task, they are:
1. Q_learning 
2. Actor-Critic
3. DQL (Deep Q_learning)
4. DAC (Deep Actor-Critic)
5. A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)
6. AlphaZero (Monte Carlo Tree Search + Deep RL) (Optional, because itâ€™s for super complex environments)

During the course of the project should, or at least try, develope these agent methods.

This section will have consistent ideas, tasks, and updates based on the projet progress.
